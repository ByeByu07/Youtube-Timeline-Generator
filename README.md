## What I Built 🎥✨  
Ever struggled with making YouTube video timelines? Like, who has the time to sit down, rewatch their entire video, and write timestamps? Not me! That’s why I built **Video to YouTube Timeline**, an app that does it for you.  

### How It Works:
1. **Upload Your Video**: Toss your video file into my app like it’s a hot potato.  
2. **Audio Extraction**: My app pulls out the audio faster than you can say “AssemblyAI.”  
3. **AI Magic**: That audio gets sent to **AssemblyAI**, where their super-smart Universal-2 model listens carefully and says, “Here’s what’s going on!”  
4. **Timeline Generation**: The app turns the AI’s notes into a perfect YouTube timeline format you can copy-paste into your video description. Boom, done. 🎉  

**Coming Soon**: You’ll even be able to link a YouTube video directly (no upload required). Just link it, get your timeline, and flex on how fast you got it done.

## Journey 🚀  
So here’s the tea ☕: I wanted to make something cool with **AssemblyAI**, and I thought, “What do YouTubers need?” A timeline generator, of course!  

The app uses **AssemblyAI’s Universal-2 Speech-to-Text Model**, which basically listens to your video’s audio and generates chapters based on what’s happening. I made sure the output is YouTube-friendly, so you don’t have to format anything. Copy. Paste. Done.  

### Key Features:
- Super-fast audio processing (because nobody likes waiting).
- Accurate chapters that make you look like a pro.
- Coming soon: Direct YouTube video linking (it’s gonna be 🔥).

## What’s Next? 🛠️  
1. **YouTube Linking**: Just link your video, skip the upload, and let the app handle the rest.  
2. **Edit Chapters**: Want to tweak those chapter names? Soon, you’ll be able to.  
3. **More AI Coolness**: Who knows what else we can automate for creators?

## Why AssemblyAI? 🤖  
Because their Universal-2 model is smart, fast, and gets the job done without breaking a sweat. (I’m convinced it’s cooler than me.)

## Team 💻  
It’s just me. A one-person army. If something breaks, blame me, too. 😅

## Fun Fact 🎉  
Building this app made me realize that AI doesn’t just listen better than me—it’s also more productive. Go figure.
